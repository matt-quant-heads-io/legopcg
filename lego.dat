1 <colour> x y z a b c d e f g h i <file>

Where:

<colour> is a number representing the colour of the part. See the Colours section for allowable colour numbers.
x y z is the x y z coordinate of the part
a b c d e f g h iis a top left 3x3 matrix of a standard 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix. This represents the rotation and scaling of the part. The entire 4x4 3D transformation matrix would then take either of the following forms:
/ a d g 0 \   / a b c x \
| b e h 0 |   | d e f y |
| c f i 0 |   | g h i z |
\ x y z 1 /   \ 0 0 0 1 /
The above two forms are essentially equivalent, but note the location of the transformation portion (x, y, z) relative to the other terms.
